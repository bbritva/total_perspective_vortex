# Feature Selection Justification:
# For this BCI project, we focused on EEG signals
# from channels C3 and C4, which correspond to the
# primary motor cortex in the international 10–10
# system. Research in motor imagery and motor execution
# shows that these regions exhibit the strongest
# modulation during hand movements. We applied
# a band-pass filter from 8–30 Hz, covering the mu (8–13 Hz)
# and beta (13–30 Hz) rhythms, which are known to reflect
# motor activity. Features such as bandpower, RMS,
# and variance were extracted to summarize the signal’s
# amplitude and spectral content. Visual inspection
# of the filtered signals shows clear differences
# between T1 and T2 classes, confirming that these
# features carry information useful for classification.
# This combination of biologically informed channel
# selection, frequency filtering, and compact signal
# features ensures that the model receives the most
# relevant input while reducing noise and irrelevant
# activity.
